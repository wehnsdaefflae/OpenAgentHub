OpenAgentHub is an open-source infrastructure framework that prepares small businesses for the upcoming era of local AI autonomy. It creates a bridge between current cloud-based AI capabilities and future local execution, ensuring businesses can benefit from AI today while maintaining independence tomorrow.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Provider Independence**: Modular architecture that works with any AI provider
- **Data Protection**: Built-in data minimization and security features
- **Future-Ready**: Designed for smooth transition to local AI execution
- **Business-First**: Focus on practical workflows and business processes
- **Open Source**: Complete transparency and community-driven development

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wehnsdaefflae/openagent-hub.git
cd openagent-hub
```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.model_interface.provider import DummyCloudProvider
from src.business_logic.workflow import WorkflowEngine, WorkflowStep
from src.security.data_protection import DataProtector

# Initialize components
provider = DummyCloudProvider()
workflow_engine = WorkflowEngine()
data_protector = DataProtector()

# Create a workflow
workflow_steps = [
    WorkflowStep(
        name="process_data",
        action="analyze_text",
        parameters={"max_length": 1000}
    )
]

# Execute workflow
workflow_name = workflow_engine.create_workflow("sample_workflow", workflow_steps)
result = workflow_engine.execute_workflow(workflow_name, {"text": "Sample input"})
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

OpenAgentHub consists of four main components:

1. **Model Interface Layer**
   - Provider abstraction
   - Data minimization
   - Local execution preparation

2. **Business Logic Layer**
   - Workflow engine
   - Template system
   - State management

3. **Security Infrastructure**
   - Data protection
   - Access control
   - Privacy guards

4. **Local Runtime**
   - Resource management
   - Performance monitoring
   - Deployment tools
